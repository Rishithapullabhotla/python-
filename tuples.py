"""
Tuples is a collection of items/values/elements
they are enclosed within the parenthesis or open brackets()seperated by(,)
As tuples are immutable it mean we cannot change
so when the data is fixed we can go with tuples...
"""
# eg-1

mytuple=(13,12,11)
print(type(mytuple))#<class tuple>
mytuple2=()#emptytupke
print(type(mytuple2))#<class tuple>
mytuple3=(10)
print(type(mytuple3))#<class int>

"""
Note: when you wanna create a tuple with single value it should be separated by so that the
compiler treats as tuple or else it just treats as integer
